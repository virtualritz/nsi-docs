The Interface Stream
--------------------

It is important for a scene description API to be streamable. This
allows saving scene description into files, communicating scene state
between processes and provide extra flexibility when sending commands to
the renderer |nsp| [#]_.

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, the authors have decided to use
exactly the same format as is used by the *RenderMan* Interface
Bytestream (RIB). This has several advantages:

-  Well defined ASCII and binary formats.

-  The ASCII format is human readable and easy to understand.

-  Easy to integrate into existing renderers (writers and readers
   already available).

Note that since Lua is part of the API, one can use Lua files for API
streaming |nsp| [#]_.

   The streamable nature of the *RenderMan* API, through RIB, is an
   undeniable advantage. RenderManÂ is a registered trademark of Pixar.

   Preliminary tests show that the Lua parser is as fast as an optimized
   ASCII RIB parser.
