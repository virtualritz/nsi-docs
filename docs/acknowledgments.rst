Many thanks to John Haddon, Daniel Dresser, David Minor, Moritz Mœller
and Gregory Ducatel for initiating the first discussions and encouraging
us to design a new scene description api. Bo Zhou and Paolo Berto helped
immensely with plug-in design which ultimately led to improvements in
nsi (e.g. adoption of the ``screen`` node). Jordan Thistlewood opened
the way for the first integration of nsi into a commercial plug-in.
Stefan Habel did a thorough proofreading of the entire document and gave
many suggestions.

The nsi logo was designed by Paolo Berto.
